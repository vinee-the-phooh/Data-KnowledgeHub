#Variables are created when we assign a value to them.

#Variables can be reassigned to different values or types.

#Variables are case-sensitive, meaning 'myVar' and 'myvar' are different variables.

#Variables can be used in expressions and functions.

#Variables can be declared using the assignment operator '='.

# Variables can be used in loops to control repetition.
# Example: Looping through a range of numbers
for i in range(3):  # i takes values 0, 1, 2
    print(i)

#Variables can be used in conditionals to make decisions.

#Variables can be passed as arguments to functions.

#Variables can be used in list comprehensions.

#Variables can be used in string formatting.

#Variables can be used in f-strings for formatting.

#Variables can be used in type annotations.

#Variables can be used in type hints for function parameters and return types.

#Variables can be used in type casting.

#Variables can be used in type coercion.

#None is equivalent to null in other languages.

#Multiple variables can be assigned in a single line using tuple unpacking.
