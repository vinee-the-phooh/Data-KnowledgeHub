# Primitive Data Types in Python

## Overview

Primitive data types are the basic building blocks of Python. They store numbers, text, and logical states â€” True/False values.  
We don't need to declare the data type explicitly in Python, since Python is dynamically typed.

## Type Conversion (Casting)

Python can change a variable's data type from one type to another.  
This is called type conversion.

There are two types of type conversion:
1. **Implicit Type Conversion**: Python automatically converts one data type to another during an operation.
2. **Explicit Type Conversion**: The user manually converts the data type using built-in functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, etc.
