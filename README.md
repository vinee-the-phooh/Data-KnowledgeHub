# Data-KnowledgeHub

# ---Welcome To My Data-KnowledgeHub---

This is my personal learning space where I explore data science, machine learning, and Python programming.I started this journey to build strong skills in data analysis, visualization, and model development.

# What This Hub Includes

This repository is a collection of my learning projects and tools as I grow in data science and machine learning. It includes:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects that explore datasets using Python, pandas, and visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Custom Exception Handling Reusable Python classes to handle and log errors clearly and consistently across different projects.

Logging System Centralized logging tools to track events, warnings, and errors—helpful for debugging and monitoring.

Modular Code Structure Clean and organized code with folders like core, utils, and components to make development easier.

Streamlit Dashboards (in progress) Interactive dashboards to present data insights in a user-friendly way.

Machine Learning Experiments (coming soon) Beginner-friendly ML models and workflows to practice training, testing, and evaluation.

# Technologies Used

This hub uses core tools and libraries commonly used in data science and machine learning:

Python 3.12.4 – Main programming language for all projects

NumPy – For numerical operations and array handling

Pandas – For data manipulation and analysis

Matplotlib & Seaborn – For data visualization

Logging – To track events, warnings, and errors

Custom Exception Classes – For structured error handling

Streamlit – To build interactive dashboards

Scikit-learn (planned) – For machine learning models and evaluation

Modular Python Structure – Clean folder organization for reusable code
