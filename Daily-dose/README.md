# Daily Dose

# Welcome to Daily Dose - my personal space for daily Python practice.

I created this project to improve my Python skills step by step. Every day, I write small code examples, try new ideas, and learn something new.

# What You Will Find Here

- Simple Python scripts for daily learning
- Practice with data types, loops, functions, and more
- Notes and comments to explain my thinking

# My Goal

I want to become better at Python and use it for data science and machine learning. This folder helps me to stay consistent and learn with practice.

# How I Use It

- I add one new file every day
- I write code and also explain it in my own words
- I try to keep things simple and clear

# Thank You

Thanks for visiting my project!!!. I hope it inspires you to practice coding daily too.
